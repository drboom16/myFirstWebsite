        <p>Yo! I'm Christian, a second year studying computer science and
          commerce. As you can probably tell, I really enjoy watching
          anime and used to obsess over having a super cool 
          wallpaper rotation on my pc with a few of these backgrounds from this 
          themed anime in particular which you'll see.
          Aside from watching shows and programming (RIP my eyesight), I also play the piano,
          drum kit (in a jazz fusion band) and the marimba.
