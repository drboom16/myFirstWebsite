        <p>Some <span class="pacifico">random ahh</span> facts about me:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Music has always been a big part of who I am. I first learnt to play the drumkit at 6, the piano at 9, and
          won the NSW State Solos for Percussion in 2022! My top 3 music genres at the moment
          would have to be soul, jazz, and indie (but I love white girl bangers as well!)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Fitness is also something I really enjoy. I regularly play basketball on
          saturdays with some mates at a rec league. At my peak, I used to go gym 6 days a week (during the mainly
          commerce terms lol)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am also a super big-back! Asian food is simply the best, and my top 3 meals
          at the moment would have to be KBBQ, banh mi and malatang. When it comes to
          all you can eat, I am always there to make a profit and will never leave scraps
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I broke my right arm four times up until the age of six,
          then I locked in and have never broken it since <span class="emoji">;^)</span>
